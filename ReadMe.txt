#Hardware:   
This code was run with the following computer specs.  
Intel Core I5-6200U CPU at 2.5GHz, 2400 Mhz, 4 Core, 8GB RAM, Windows 10

#Software:   
This project used Python 3.7 and incorporated multiple python packages available at www.anaconda.com

#Data:
Kaggle Dataset:  www.kaggle.com
Sponsorship:   scraped off internet, multiple sources

#How to Run Model
First run "Project 5 - March Madness Data Prep.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook to create our dataset.
Then run "Project 5 - Model.ipynb" to run the classification model.

#Side Effects:
Running the code will overwrite the existing files.

#Assumptions: 
We only use our regular season data to test our tournament results since the goal of the exercise is to use all data available to use to predict matchup winners in this years Tournament.

That said, I'll assume I had a perfect model until proved otherwise.
